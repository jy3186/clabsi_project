# CLABSI_project
This is a clinical nutrition research studying on the relationship between parenteral nutrition and bloodstream infections in the sample population of central lined patients collected from New York Presbyterian Hospital in Columbia University Irving Medical Center from January 2020 to September 2022.

Introduction:
There is a risk of bacterial infection in the bloodstream when catheters are used, with increased use of parenteral nutrition intravenously. Parenteral Nutrition has been established as a main risk factor for Central-Lined Associated Bloodstream Infections. 
There are new preventive methods to decrease the incidence of CLABSI when using parenteral nutrition and there is a need to see whether PN is still a risk for these infections. By analyzing the experience of previously hospitalized patients in a given period, we hope to develop a risk profile with specific risk factors to improve the care of those at risk.

Study Aims: 
Our objective is to determine whether patients receiving PN are at higher risk for CLABSI than those with central lines who did not receive PN. We aim to do a retrospective study by accessing patientsâ€™ data and evaluate the list of variables as risk factors of CLABSIs for further analysis. Patient data will be accessed from EMR via clinical data warehouse, up to this point we received data on bloodstream infections with positive blood culture. 

Hypotheses: 
The hypothesis is that Parenteral Nutrition increases the risks of getting bloodstream infections in central-lined patients within 14-day period after their insertion.

Methods: 
Data set is from extracted from EMR in the system of New York Presbyterian Hospital from January 2020 to September 2022. (Demographic description needed) and there are 6754 of patients with central line inserted as sample population. We used SAS and R markdown to view, import and clean the datasets. Univariate analysis was performed on the research and multivariable analysis including regression and confounder adjusting will be further assessed in the data analysis. We will conduct an incidence density sampling for nested case control study design.
